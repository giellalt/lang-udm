Udmurt transcription
====================

Introduction
------------

Udmurt is written with the Cyrillic alphabet. In the parser, the
alphabet is rendered with the following symbols:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

          a b v g d e ë ð  ð¤  z z¤ i ï j k l m n o ö p r s
                        zh zh" z z"

          t u f h  c  þ  þ¤  §  §¤    x    y '    ê    û  â
                kh ts ch ch" sh shtsh hard   soft eab. ju ja

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the table above, line 1 and 3 gives the Latin symbols used in the
present parser, in the same order as the Cyrillic letters are listed in
the Udmurt alphabet. Mostly, the values of the letters are self-evident,
in the cases where they are not, some help is given in lines 2 and 4, in
form of common letter sequences used for transcribing Cyrillic text..
The symbol **"** (in *z"* etc.) refers to the Udmurt consonants with
diaeresis. The Udmurt alphabet is found in standard grammars, and online
at
[www,evertype.com/alpha/udm.pdf](http://www.evertype.com/alpha/udm.pdf).

At some point, the parser will be transferred to utf-8, and the letters
and symbols used here will be replaced with the original Cyrillic ones.
