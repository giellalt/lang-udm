<h1>Udmurt transcription</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

Udmurt is written with the Cyrillic alphabet. In the parser, the
alphabet is rendered with the following symbols:<p>

<hr>
<pre>
      a b v g d e ë ð  ð¤  z z¤ i ï j k l m n o ö p r s
                    zh zh" z z"

      t u f h  c  þ  þ¤  §  §¤    x    y '    ê    û  â
            kh ts ch ch" sh shtsh hard   soft eab. ju ja
</pre>
<hr>

In the table above, line 1 and 3 gives the Latin symbols used in the
present parser, in the same order as the Cyrillic letters are listed
in the Udmurt alphabet. Mostly, the values of the letters are
self-evident, in the cases where they are not, some help is given in
lines 2 and 4, in form of common letter sequences used for
transcribing Cyrillic text.. The symbol <b>"</b> (in <i>z"</i> etc.)
refers to the Udmurt consonants with diaeresis. The Udmurt alphabet is
found in standard grammars, and online at <a
href="http://www.evertype.com/alpha/udm.pdf">www,evertype.com/alpha/udm.pdf</a>.<p>

At some point, the parser will be transferred to utf-8, and the
letters and symbols used here will be replaced with the original
Cyrillic ones.<p>
