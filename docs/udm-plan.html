<h1>A plan for the work</h1>

One parser is needed, it should be made for the Cyrillic
alphabet. Texts based upon the Latin transcription found in corpora in
the west, should be converted into a cyrillic version before analysis,
and then transferred back at output.<p>

While waiting for Cyrillic-based tools (emacs etc), a version will be
made with Latin symbols in a one-to-one relation to the Cyrillic
alphabet.<p>


<ol>
  <li> Get localisation infrastructure in place for Cyrillic
       <ol>
	 <li> Unicode-enabled Xerox tools
	 <li> Fonts
	 <li> Keyboard
	 <li> Linux tools (emacs, command line tools, etc.)
       </ol>
  <li> Decide upon transcription for the Latin version
  <li> Set up relevant sets of phonemes, for latin and cyrillic version
  <li> Decide on a grammatical tag set
  <li> Write a sketch of the grammar, on paper
  <li> Write the morphological transducer
  <li> Get a lexicon
</ol>
